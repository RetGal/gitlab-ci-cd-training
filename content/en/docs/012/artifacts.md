Jobs can output an archive of files and directories. This output is known as a job artifact.
You can download job artifacts by using the GitLab UI.

Example of an artifact definition:

```yaml
pdf:
  script: xelatex mycv.tex
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - mycv.pdf
    expire_in: 1 week
```

The `paths` keyword determines which files to add to the job artifacts. All paths to files and directories are relative to the repository where the job was created.

The `expire_in` keyword determines how long GitLab keeps the job artifacts. You can also use the UI to keep job artifacts from expiring. If `expire_in` is not defined, the instance-wide setting is used.
