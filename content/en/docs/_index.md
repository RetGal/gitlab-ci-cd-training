[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is the open DevOps platform, delivered as a single application. This makes GitLab unique and creates a streamlined software workflow, unlocking your organization from the constraints of a pieced together toolchain. Learn how GitLab offers unmatched visibility and higher levels of efficiency in a single application across the DevOps lifecycle.

GitLab started as an open source project to help teams collaborate on software development. GitLab's mission is to provide a place where everyone can contribute. Each team member uses our product internally and directly impacts the company roadmap. This exceptional approach works because we're a team of passionate people who want to see each other, the company, and the broader GitLab community succeed and we have the platform to make that possible.


[GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) is a tool built into GitLab for software development through the continuous methodologies:

* Continuous Integration (CI)
* Continuous Delivery (CD)
* Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Integration works by pushing small code chunks to your applicationâ€™s codebase hosted in a Git repository, and to every push, run a pipeline of scripts to build, test, and validate the code changes before merging them into the main branch.

Continuous Delivery and Deployment consist of a step further CI, deploying your application to production at every push to the default branch of the repository.

These methodologies allow you to catch bugs and errors early in the development cycle, ensuring that all the code deployed to production complies with the code standards you established for your app.
