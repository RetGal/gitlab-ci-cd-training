Use `include` to include external YAML files in your CI/CD configuration. You can break down one long gitlab-ci.yml file into multiple files to increase readability, or reduce duplication of the same configuration in multiple places.


You can also store template files in a central repository and include them in projects.

include requires the external YAML file to have the extensions `.yml` or `.yaml`, otherwise the external file is not included.

You canâ€™t use YAML anchors across different YAML files sourced by include. You can only refer to anchors in the same file. To reuse configuration from different YAML files, use !reference tags or the extends keyword.
